This is a repository that contains codes for my blog article, [Client-Side Authentication in Next.js using Cookies](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/client-side-authentication-in-nextjs-using-cookies)

It works by using a RouteGuard component, which wraps around the page components, and redirects the users if the user is not authenticated.
